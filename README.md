## Image Similarity Project
This project aims to implement an image similarity detection system using a pre-trained MobileNet model. The system extracts feature vectors from images and finds the most similar images from a dataset based on these feature vectors.

## Project Structure
- Data_location: Directory containing the dataset of animal images.
- Database_location: Directory where the selected images are copied for processing.
- predict function: Function to preprocess images and extract feature vectors using MobileNet.
- Main script: Script to handle the overall process of copying images, extracting features, and finding similar images.
